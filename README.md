This project is  my final assignment to take the degree of facilities at Ahmad Dahlan University. 
This application is useful for providing sentiment info on comments and posts in blog posts (wordpress).

### Required:
- python
- <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress</a>


### How to use this app
1. Restfull API
- extract RestAPI_python.zip
- run on pyhton with this script "python app.py" in your extract folder
- if error. There are no modules needed such as literature, flask etc., install first ex: pip install flask

2. Wordpress
- install the plugin with wordpress (open TAnalyzer.zip)
- enable plugin (after restAPII running)
- if want to use my data please comment import my database.db / my database.sql with phmyadmin
